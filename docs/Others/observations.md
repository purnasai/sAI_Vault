Must not forget that Detectron2, Pytorch-lightning, Hugging-face transformers, and Pytorch has option to resume training.

With this resume training option, we can continuously train on colab. 


`image.shape` works in opencv
    - outputs (height, width, channels)
    
`image.size` works in PIL(pillow)
    - outputs (width,height).
    - img.mode gives no.of.channels like `RGB`.
then what is torch follows..?
