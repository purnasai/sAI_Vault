- used in python, used at the end of a file.
- This line in .py file seperates executable code and utility functions code.

```
# Example module.py

def some_function():
    # Code for a specific function

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Code that should only run when this script is executed directly
    print("This will only execute when module.py is run directly")
    # You might put some testing code or initialization code here

```

It's not mandatory to include `if __name__ == "__main__":` in every Python file, but it's a good practice for creating reusable modules and for separating executable code from module definitions.
