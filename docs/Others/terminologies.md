This page has all terminologies / nominclature / nuance that we use in Data Science lifecycle.

### GIT
- staging branch
- main/master branch
- test branch
- push/pull/merge/
- commit
- checkout
- HEAD

### Environment
- Test environment
- production environment
- staging environment

### CMD
- putty
- power shell
- command prompt

### Project
- SME-Subject matter expertise
- SPOC- Single point of contact
- MVP- Minimum viable product
- UAT- User acceptance testing

### Deployment
- Synchronous(one request at a time)- serial request handler
- Asynchronous(multi requests at a time)- Parallel requests handler
- latency(task completion time)
- throughput(no.of.requests to handle)
- Deploy/Ship
- logging
- monitoring
- metrics
- model explainabillity
- hyper parameter tuning
- data drift
- Concept drift (condition to decide churn, now changed over time)
- model drift
- Reproducebility
- trigger based model retraining
- fixed window size data(from last year to current day)
- dynamic window size(moving average)
- Migrate(from pytorch to pytorch_lightning)
- Integrate(combine all modules)
- feasibility study
- Scoping
- Requirements
- MVP(Minimum viable product)
- UAT(user acceptance testing)
- Business metric(increase in email openings)
- Model metric(classification & regression)

## MODELs:
**Knowledge distillation** involves training a smaller model (student) to mimic the behavior of a larger, pre-trained model (teacher) like BERT. Distillbert is Smaller & quicker to Bert. This compact model learns not just the teacherâ€™s predictions but also its confidence and reasoning. This approach is particularly useful when deploying BERT on resource-constrained devices.

- latency- delay b/n input & output.
- throughput- no of predictions a model can handle in specific time.
- zero, one, few shot learning
- test/UAT environment
- Pre-production environment
- production environment
- deployment environment
- stateless training (from sebastian raschaka Q&A book)
- statefull training
- data-centric ai(focus on data to improve performance.)
- model-centric ai(focus on model to improve performance.)

### Startup
- bootstraped- self funding with no external
- Vertical SAAS- Building on single usecase indepth- End-to-End
- Horizontal SAAS- Building on Multiple usecases paralelly like detection, classification, ocr all at once. 

### Others
- Mutually exclusive: 2 events won't happen simultaneously.
- Non Mutually Exclusive: 2 events occur same time.
