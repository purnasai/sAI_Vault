### Multiplexers
- Terminal multiplexers like Tmux([cheatsheet](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com)), Screen(same as tmux) are very useful to run multiple operations at same time.

```cmd
tmux ls
tumx new-session -s ray_llm for new-session
tmux attach-session -t ray_llm for attach-session
ctrl+b d to detach session
```
