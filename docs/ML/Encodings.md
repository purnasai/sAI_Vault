One-Hot Encoding (OHE): This method creates binary columns (0 or 1) for each category in a categorical feature. It is suitable for categorical features with a small number of unique values, such as the column with 6 categorical values in your dataset. OHE is easy to implement and can work well with various machine learning algorithms, including linear models and tree-based models.

Label Encoding: This method assigns a numerical label to each category in a categorical feature. It is suitable for ordinal categorical features where the categories have a meaningful order, but may not be appropriate for nominal categorical features where the categories have no inherent order. Label encoding is useful when dealing with a large number of unique values in a categorical feature, such as the column with 35 categorical values in your dataset. However, be cautious when using label encoding with algorithms that assume numerical values have ordinal relationships, as it may introduce unintended biases.

Binary Encoding: This method combines aspects of both one-hot encoding and label encoding. It represents each category in a categorical feature with a binary code, which reduces the number of columns compared to OHE, but still captures the unique values. Binary encoding can be useful when dealing with moderate-sized categorical features, such as the column with 15 categorical values in your dataset.

Count Encoding: This method replaces each category in a categorical feature with its frequency (or count) in the dataset. It can be useful when dealing with high-cardinality categorical features, such as the column with 20 categorical values in your dataset.

Target Encoding: This method replaces each category in a categorical feature with the mean of the target variable for that category. It can be useful for improving the predictive power of a model when there is a relationship between the categorical feature and the target variable.


From Chatgpt:
Simply this

For a column with 6 categorical values: One-Hot Encoding (OHE) is typically suitable.
For a column with 20 categorical values: Count Encoding or Target Encoding may be appropriate.
For a column with 15 categorical values: Binary Encoding could be a good choice.
For a column with 35 categorical values: Binary Encoding or Target Encoding might be suitable.
